# DevOps-90days

I am following saiyam's roadmap, so it will take around 6 months, but i plan on splitting it in two sprints. 90 days + 90 days.
Topics:
- prerequisites:
  - Linux
  - Basic networking
  - Introduction to yaml
  - Git and github
- Cloud
- virtualization and containers
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD
- IAC (Infrastructure as code)
- Observability
- Chaos engineering
- Policy
- Service Mesh

### The resources are placed in the order I have used them to study.

Since I will be switching between resources, I dont have a fully defined plan, I will update things while I go on with it.

## Linux:
- 3 days per week (monday, wednesday and friday). with the deadline being 28 April.
- I am following edX course LFS101x till chapter 3.
- seperately understood basic concepts like processes, linux filesystem etc. [link](https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/tlk-toc.html).
- for linux commands and hands on practice, studied from kunal's linux video. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwolPf6kN-k&t=1285s).
- Stopped here for now, will do advanced topics later on, when needed.

## Networking:
- 3 days per week (tuesday, thursday, saturday).
- Kunal kushwaha's networking course, good enough to get you up and running. [Computer networking full course by Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvYjXCsTg8&t=6012s).
- CCNA course by network kings, great for subnetting and hardware related explanations. [CCNA by network kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3QK2UquxM).
- It should take me around 4 weeks, so the deadline is around 18 may, ill finish it sooner though, as i know bits and pieces.

## Docker:
- Started with kunal kushwaha's docker video, it is good for hands on practice and beginner level explanation.[Docker by Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Bl31rlnRM&t=2222s).
- For clear understanding of how containers work, their architecture and their creation using linux concepts like Namespaces, Cgroups and many more, I used saiyam pathak's Docker deep dive video.[Docker deep dive session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buHPsFgpsgU).
- Creating containers from scratch. This part is not mandatory, but yes it sure clears the picture about containers by building it. I seperately read about concepts like Chroot, Linux Namespaces, Cgroups etc for clear understanding of how contianers are created [Kernel namespaces and cgroups](https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504), [Creating containers from scratch-Docker docs](https://youtu.be/8fi7uSYlOdc). Docker docs has everything you need regarding this.[Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
- I already did kunal's video and building containers from scratch before the challenge, it should take you around a week. This part is very important! invest your time on this.
## YAML:
- 1 day.
- Learnt from Kunal Kushwaha's YAML course for beginners [YAML for beginners by kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA90BTozdow&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnoqBXdMwUTRod4Gi3eac2Ak&index=5).

## Cloud (Azure):
- 3 days per week (tuesday, thursday and saturday).
- AZ-900 on freeCodeCamp youtube channel [AZ-900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEFWyqJ5XA&list=WL&index=132&t=12s).

## Kubernetes:
- 3 days per week (monday, wednesday and friday).
- Kubernetes course for beginner by Kunal Kushwaha [Kubernetes for beginners by Kunal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVBON1lA9N8&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnoqBXdMwUTRod4Gi3eac2Ak&index=7).

## CI/CD:
- **GitHub actions**
