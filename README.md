# DevOps-100days

I am following saiyam's roadmap, so it will take around 6 months, but i plan on splitting it in two sprints. 100days + 80 days.
Topics:
- prerequisites:
  - Linux
  - Basic networking
  - Introduction to yaml
  - Git and github
- Cloud
- virtualization and containers
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD
- IAC (Infrastructure as code)
- Observability
- Chaos engineering
- Policy
- Service Mesh

Since i will be switching between resources, i dont have a fully defined plan, i will update things while i go on with it.

## Linux:
- I plan on doing 3 sessions on it per week (monday, wednesday and friday). with the deadline being 2nd july.
- I am following edX course LFS101x.
- I do read articles about things i dont clearly understand.

## Networking:
- Following the CCNA course by network kings and kunal kushwaha's networking video.
- 3 days per week (tuesday, thursday, saturday).
- It should take me around 4 weeks, so the deadline is around 18 may, ill finish it sooner though, as i know bits and pieces.

will update more because i have to manage college as well !
