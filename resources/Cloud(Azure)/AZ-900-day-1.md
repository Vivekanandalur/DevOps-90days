### What is cloud computing ?
process of using a network of remote servers which is hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data instead of doing it on the local machines on local premise.

### Types:
- #### Dedicated server:
  - Very expensive, high maintainance and high security because the organization itself installs and maintains the infrastructure.
- #### Virtual private server:
  - One physical machine is broken into several virtualized sub machines, that run different web-apps and sites.
- #### Shared hosting:
  - Very cheap, very limited because one physical machine is shared by many users.
- #### Cloud hosting:
  - Flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective and highly configurable because multiple physical machines act as one system and the underlying complexities are abstracted for multiple cloud services, that are user friendly.

### Common cloud services:
- Compute: 
  - its like a virtual computer that can run applications, programs and code.
- Storage: 
  - Its like a virtual hard-drive that can store your files.
- Networking: 
  - A virtual network that connects your various other services like compute, storage etc.
- Database: 
  - A virtual database.

### Benifits of Cloud computing:
- cost-effective
- global
- secure
- reliable
- scalable
- elastic
- current

### Technical Terms
In order to understand Cloud Computing, you need to understand some technical terms.
- **High Availability (HA)** - you get high availability for your servers by replacing instantly the failed server with the new one. HA depends on the number of VMs that you set up to eventually cover in case one goes down. This is done with the help of laod balancer.
- **Fault Tolerance** - Fault tolerance means that if there is any fault from the Azure side, then it is immediately mitigated by Azure itself with zero down time 
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)** - In case of any catastrophic disaster like  cyber-attack, there is a plan in DR to recover your business from these critical systems or in normal operation if such an event occurs
- **Scalability** - In cloud computing, scalability means addition or removal of the resources in an easy and quick way as per demand. It is of two types, horizontal and vertical.
- **Elasticity** - Elasticity is the capacity to dynamically extend or minimize network resources to respond to autonomous working load adjustments and optimize the use of resources
- **Agility** - Agility is the capability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in the business environment. Agility also refers to the ability to quickly develop, test and deploy business-led software applications

### Types of Cloud Computing
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) usually for administrators. Example: Azure, oracle cloudl, AWS etc.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) usually for developers where they deploy their applications. Example: heroku etc.
- Serverless
- SaaS (Software as a Service) usually for customers where the softwares are provided and maintained by cloud providers. Example: office 360, Gmail etc.
