### What is cloud computing ?
process of using a network of remote servers which is hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data instead of doing it on the local machines on local premise.

### Types:
- #### Dedicated server:
  - Very expensive, high maintainance and high security because the organization itself installs and maintains the infrastructure.
- #### Virtual private server:
  - One physical machine is broken into several virtualized sub machines, that run different web-apps and sites.
- #### Shared hosting:
  - Very cheap, very limited because one physical machine is shared by many users.
- #### Cloud hosting:
  - Flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective and highly configurable because multiple physical machines act as one system and the underlying complexities are abstracted for multiple cloud services, that are user friendly.

### Common cloud services:
- Compute: 
  - its like a virtual computer that can run applications, programs and code.
- Storage: 
  - Its like a virtual hard-drive that can store your files.
- Networking: 
  - A virtual network that connects your various other services like compute, storage etc.
- Database: 
  - A virtual database.

### Benifits of Cloud computing:
- cost-effective
- global
- secure
- reliable
- scalable
- elastic
- current

### Technical Terms
In order to understand Cloud Computing, you need to understand some technical terms.
- **High Availability (HA)** - you get high availability for your servers by replacing instantly the failed server with the new one. HA depends on the number of VMs that you set up to eventually cover in case one goes down. This is done with the help of laod balancer.
- **Fault Tolerance** - Fault tolerance means that if there is any fault from the Azure side, then it is immediately mitigated by Azure itself with zero down time 
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)** - In case of any catastrophic disaster like  cyber-attack, there is a plan in DR to recover your business from these critical systems or in normal operation if such an event occurs
- **Scalability** - In cloud computing, scalability means addition or removal of the resources in an easy and quick way as per demand. It is of two types, horizontal and vertical.
- **Elasticity** - Elasticity is the capacity to dynamically extend or minimize network resources to respond to autonomous working load adjustments and optimize the use of resources
- **Agility** - Agility is the capability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in the business environment. Agility also refers to the ability to quickly develop, test and deploy business-led software applications

### Types of Cloud Computing
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) usually for administrators. Example: Azure, oracle cloudl, AWS etc.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) usually for developers where they deploy their applications. Example: heroku etc.
- Serverless
- SaaS (Software as a Service) usually for customers where the softwares are provided and maintained by cloud providers. Example: office 360, Gmail etc.

### What is Azure?
Microsoft Azure is known as Windows Azure and it is a Public Cloud. It is free to build, manage and deploy applications with your favorite tools and
frames in a huge, global network. Azure is considered for offering both IaaS and PaaS. Azure offers over 100 services, from the execution of existing
applications on virtual machines to exploration of new tech paradigms like smart bots and mixed reality.

In order to use Azure, you first need to setup an Azure account directly by going to “Azure.com” or with the help of a representative. You can sign-up to
Azure as a Free account with free USD 200 credit and 25+ free services.

#### Azure Market Place
The Azure market place offers technical solutions and services from Microsoft and partners to build and extend Azure products and services. It
has all kinds of services and applications like VMs, templates, apps, and Azure managed services etc.

#### Global Footprint
Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider — which offers the scale required to bring users around the world closer to applications.
There are 58 regions of Azure that are available around the world with 140 available in 140 countries.

### Regions

Regions are geographical areas where Azure is present to deploy the Azure resources. It is a set of data centers with latency-defined perimeter connected
via a dedicated regional low-latency network. How to Choose a Region?
When you are choosing a region, you need to think about three things mainly:
- Location
- Features
- Price

#### Geographies/Paired Regions
Geography is a distinct market that usually conserves data residence and compliance boundaries with two or more regions within the same geographic area.
#### Availability Set
An Availability Set is a logical grouping function that can be used to separate VM resources from each other.
#### Availability Zone
Availability Zones (AZ) are locations within an Azure region that are physically separate. An availability zone is composed of one or more
independently operating power, and network data centers. Each region has a minimum of three zones.

### Azure Services
There is a number of available services and features in Azure. The most commonly used categories are:
- Compute
- Networking
- Storage
- Mobile
- Databases
- Web
- Internet of Things
- Big Data
- Artificial Intelligence
- Security and Identity
- Monitoring and Management

#### Compute
In Azure, there is a number of options that are available for application and service hosting. Azure Compute provides you an infrastructure where you can run your applications.
#### Networking
The key function of Azure networking is the relation of compute resources and access to applications. There are various networking services in Azure that can be used individually or together. Azure networking provides you the most secure environment for your data as compared to any other Cloud Platform.
#### Storage
Azure Storage is a cloud storage system from Microsoft that helps to store up-to-date files. Azure Storage offers an extremely scalable data object store, a cloud file system service, a reliable message store, and a NoSQL store. Azure Storage is secure, highly available and durable, scalable, managed and accessible.
#### Data and Analytics
Data is available in all sizes and formats. When they speak about Big Data, it means they refer to large volumes of information. It often is so large that it is no longer appropriate for traditional methods of processing and analysis. To cope with these large data sets, Open Source cluster technologies have been developed. Microsoft Azure offers a wide range of Big Data and analytics tools and services.
#### Databases
Azure Database is a fully managed service. It has business-grade efficiency with integrated high availability that ensures you can easily scale and hit global distribution without needing to pay attention to costly downtime.
#### Web and Mobile
Great web experience in today's business is important. Azure provides premium support for the creation and management of web applications and HTTP-based web services. Azure builds engaging cross platforms for Android, iOS and Windows applications without any compromises that suit your business needs and reach to your customers everywhere.
#### Security and Identity
We know that safety is one thing in the cloud and it is very important to have accurate and timely Azure Security information. Azure has a wide range of security tools and features that make it the best reason to use for your applications and services. You can protect Azure identity and access management solutions for your applications and data on the front door.
#### Monitoring and Management
Azure management and governance tools help system managers and developers to secure and compliant the resources, both in-house and on the cloud. It monitors the infrastructure, software, system provision and set-up, app-updating, vulnerability detection, backup resources, disaster recovery, policy implementation, process automation, and even the management of costs— during the IT cycle.
